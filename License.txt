- **`requirements.txt`**: Include any dependencies, like `requests`, `sqlite3`, `matplotlib`, etc.
- **`main.py`**: This will be your main script where you implement the data retrieval and processing logic.
- **`utils.py`**: Consider creating utility functions for temperature conversion, database interactions, etc.
- **Testing**: Set up basic unit tests for your functions to ensure everything works as intended.
